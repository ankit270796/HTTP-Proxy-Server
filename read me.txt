In this programming assignmnet we program an HTTP Proxy Server. HTTP proxy server is a type of server which
sits in between the host and the server on the Internet. This assigment is based on the HTML 1.1. Every time a host
wants to make a request it has to establish a new TCP connection, so we end up wasting 2 round trip time even before 
the required date is requested. This makes the connection very slow when the server is sitting far away from the client. 
Hence, some people created the concept of proxy server to cater frequently used pages faster. 
Every time a client/host makes a request for some webpage, the proxy server checks for that webpage to see if that
request has been accessed earlier. If that request was made earlier proxy server would have cached that page in the
memory, so it instead of sending the request to the server on internet it directly caters the request. Therefore 
this makes it faster to access the webpages. If the webpage is not present in the Cache, or expired. The proxy server
will forward the request to required host. After, the server receives the response from the external host. It caches 
the result to serve the similiar requests in future. Every time it caches the page on cache it sets the expire time 
field to make sure that no client is served with the expired data. Our proxy server only stores the 10 least recently
used entries into the cache.
